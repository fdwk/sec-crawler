At December\\n31, 1994, earning assets were $4.317 billion compared to $4.309 billion at\\nDecember 31, 1993.  The combined increase from loans, federal funds sold and\\nsecurities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements more than offset the\\ndecline in securities experienced during 1994.\\n\\n     Total loans increased by $116.5 million or 5.22% during 1994.\\nMississippi's switch from an agricultural-based economy to a more\\nmanufacturing-based economy has provided an increased demand for business\\nlending.  This conversion plus an increased marketing effort by the Corporation\\nare the primary factors for the $63.8 million increase in commercial and\\nindustrial loans during 1994.  The Corporation's co\", \"e were $452.6 million and $439.7 million,\\nrespectively.  This resulted in an unrecognized loss, net of tax, of\\napproximately $7.97 million as a separate component of stockholders' equity.\\n\\n     During 1994, the Corporation decreased the size of its short-term\\nportfolio as it sought funds for loan growth and the reduction of its overnight\\nborrowing needs.  Products included in the short-term portfolio are primarily\\nU. S. Government agency securities classified as available for sale and reverse\\nrepurchase agreements.  As necessary, this portfolio is utilized as an\\nalternative to the overnight funds market and has contributed an additional\\n$721 thousand in interest income when compared to investments in the overnight\\nfunds market. The short-term portfolio will continue to play a vital role in\\nmaintaining the Corporation's liquidity and profitability.\\n\\n     In 1994, realized gains were $4.197 million on securities available for\\nsale while realized losses totaled $5.594 million, resulting i\", \"es called prior to their\\nmaturity. Gross unrealized gains approximated $5.3 million and gross unrealized\\nlosses approximated $82.3 million on securities classified as held to maturity\\nat December 31, 1994.\\n\\n     Federal funds sold and securities purchased under reverse repurchase\\nagreements increased by $10.5 million when compared to the end of 1993. Market\\nconditions and liquidity needs are the driving forces behind the utilization of\\nfederal funds sold and securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements\\nas short-term investment products.  Trading account securities continue to\\nrepresent an immaterial portion of the balance sheet.\\n\\nDEPOSITS AND OTHER INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES\\n\\n     Deposits are the primary source of funding for the Corporation's earning\\nassets.

As the rates on other money market products began to\\nrise, the Corporation successfully offered a certificate of deposit product\\nwith a step-up feature that allowed it to retain its core deposit customers. In\\n1995, Management's strategy will be to increase core deposits and to reduce the\\nCorporation's dependence on short-term borrowings, principally federal funds\\npurchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements.

Magma is seeking new long-term final standard offer\\nno. 4 power purchase agreements in the Salton Sea area through the bidding\\nprocess adopted by the CPUC under its 1992 Biennial Resource Plan Update\\n(\"BRPU\"). In its 1992 BRPU, the CPUC cited the need for an additional 9,600 MW\\nof power production through 1999 among California\\'s three investor-owned\\nutilities, SCE, SDG&E and Pacific Gas and Electric Company. Of this amount, 275\\nMW was set aside for bidding by independent power producers (such as Magma)\\nutilizing renewable resources. Pursuant to an order of t', 'cuted an agreement\\nwith SCE on March 16, 1995 providing that in certain circumstances it would\\nwithdraw its SCE BRPU bid in consideration for the payment of certain sums. Such\\nagreement does not effect Magma\\'s award from SDG&E.\\n\\n        Fish Lake/Salton Sea 1 Expansion. The Salton Sea 1 Project has an option\\nto supply an additional 20 MW of power to SCE under the Salton Sea 1 PPA. Magma,\\nthrough its wholly-owned subsidiary, Fish Lake Power Company (\"FLPC\"), acquired\\nin 1992 a modified SO4 power purchase agreement (the \"Fish Lake SO4\") to supply\\nelectric power to SCE from a 16 MW geothermal power plant proposed to be built\\nat Fish Lake in Esmeralda County, Nevada (the \"Fish Lake Project\").\\n\\n         The Fish Lake SO4 is a 30-year contract providing for a contract\\ncapacity of 14 MW and a contract nameplate of 16 MW. The contract capacity\\npayment under the Fish Lake SO4 is levelized in the contract for the full\\n30-year term of the contract at $180 per kW-year. The capacity portion (plus\\nb', 'ied amount which decreases each year. For the last 15 years of the Fish\\nLake SO4, the energy payment will be based on SCE\\'s Avoided Cost of Energy.\\n\\n         On November 29, 1994, SCE filed an application with the CPUC seeking\\napproval for the proposed restructuring of (i) the Salton Sea 1 PPA and (ii)\\nthe Fish Lake SO4, whereby the Fish Lake Project would not be developed at its\\npresent site in Nevada\\'s Fish Lake Valley and instead would be developed under\\nan amended and restated 30-year power purchase agreement (the \"Amended PPA\") in\\nconjunction with the Salton Sea 1 PPA. If approved, the Amended PPA will\\nconsolidate the Salton Sea 1 Project Expansion with the Fish Lake Project. The\\nAmended PPA also would reduce the price for contract capacity payments to\\n$158/kW-year and would alter the energy payment schedule to commence in 1996 at\\n8.8 cents per kWh.\\n\\n        Newberry.

Although it is USAI's  intent,  and\\nManagement  believes  that the  Company  has the  ability to own the Notes until\\nmaturity, under the terms of the subordinated deben\", \"terms of which require  principal\\npayments  as the Notes  mature and  interest  payments  quarterly  (see  further\\ndiscussion  under  CONVERTIBLE  SUBORDINATED  DEBENTURE);  and 3) USAI  utilized\\napproximately  $3,563,000  of its own cash.  Although it is USAI's  intent,  and\\nManagement  believes  that the  Company  has the  ability to own the Notes until\\nmaturity, under the terms of the subordinated debenture with ML, ML has retained\\nthe right to acquire the Notes collateralizing the reverse repurchase agreements\\nwith broker-dealers and the Company's  obligation under the debenture payable to\\nML.\\n\\n     During  calendar 1994 the Federal  Reserve Board raised  interest  rates to\\naddress perceived  inflationary  pressures and could raise rates for such reason\\nin the  future.  Notwithstanding  the fact that the  coupon on the Notes  resets\\nevery 30 days,  the Notes  have  been and may in the  future be priced to actual\\nmaturity as opposed to the reset date due to the lagging index used to\", \" to\\naddress perceived  inflationary  pressures and could raise rates for such reason\\nin the  future.  Notwithstanding  the fact that the  coupon on the Notes  resets\\nevery 30 days,  the Notes  have  been and may in the  future be priced to actual\\nmaturity as opposed to the reset date due to the lagging index used to determine\\nthe coupon rate. As a  consequence,  as interest rates increase the market value\\nof the Notes may decrease,  which could result in the  broker-dealers  under the\\nreverse repurchase agreements to request additional collateral. In addition, the\\nspread between  interest due to the  broker-dealers  and the interest earning on\\nthe Notes with a lagging index may increase,  increasing the Company's  interest\\nexpense. To reduce this risk the Company purchases Eurodollar puts.\\n\\n     During fiscal 1995, USAI purchased put options on Eurodollar  futures which\\nexpired resulting in a $231,625 loss. The options were purchased in an effort to\\nreduce  USAI's  exposure  to  tempor\", \"y reduce the amount of fund\\nexpenses it is bearing.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n     At fiscal  year-end  the Notes  purchased  by the  Company  had an  average\\nmaturity of less than two years. The Notes have a face value of $117.525 million\\nwhich is greater  than the  Company's  purchase  price.  As of June 30, 1995 the\\nCompany had approximately $116.7 million in debt related to the Notes (comprised\\nof the $4.5 million  balance on the ML debenture and $112.2 million  advanced by\\nbrokers pursuant to reverse repurchase agreement  transactions).  The ML note is\\nessentially  unsecured  with ML  looking  to the  collateral  under the  reverse\\nrepurchase  agreements as its primary  source  payment.  The reverse  repurchase\\nagreements  with  the  broker-dealers  are  backed  with  collateral  valued  at\\napproximately $113 million.  The broker-dealers  have and continue to extend the\\nagreements;  however,  if all of the  broker-dealers  refused to roll-over their\\nrepurchase  agreements there would be suffic\", 'eralizing  the reverse repurchase  agreements with  broker-dealers and its\\nobligation under the debenture payable to ML.\\n\\n     During fiscal 1995,  USAI  purchased put options on Eurodollar  futures for\\napproximately  $274,125 in premiums which expired  resulting in a $231,625 loss.\\nThe options were  purchased with the  expectation  that they would reduce USAI\\'s\\nexposure  to  temporary  declines  in the value of the Notes and  reduce  USAI\\'s\\nexposure to increased interest costs of the reverse repurchase agreements in the\\nevent of a significant  increase in interest rates. During the fourth quarter of\\nFiscal  1995,   USAI  purchased  35  put  options  on  Eurodollar   futures  for\\napproximately  $13,700 in premiums  which expire in September  1995 which reduce\\nthe risk of declines in the value of the Notes held by approximately  13%.
